<P>Comali, directed by Pradeep Ranganathan, is a fun, emotional entertainer that explores how the world changes over time. Jayam Ravi plays Ravi, a man who wakes up from a coma after 16 years and struggles to adjust to the modern, fast-paced world.

While the first half is lighthearted and packed with laughs, the second half gets more emotional and message-driven. Yogi Babu’s comic timing adds charm, and Kajal Aggarwal plays her role well. Comali isn’t perfect, but it’s a feel-good film with heart, humor, and a thoughtful message about holding onto humanity in a digital age.</P>

The action sequences are epic, and the visuals are even grander than the first film. M.M. Keeravani’s score uplifts every scene.

<p>Velaikkaran, directed by Mohan Raja, is a socially conscious action-drama that tackles issues of consumerism, corporate greed, and worker exploitation. Sivakarthikeyan plays Arivu, a young man from the slums who starts working in a big FMCG company and gradually realizes the dark truths behind the glossy brand image.

Fahadh Faasil delivers a sharp performance as the suave yet manipulative antagonist. While the film is slightly long and leans heavy on messaging, it’s well-intentioned and thought-provoking. Anirudh’s background score and songs like “Karuthavanlaam Galeejaam” add energy. Velaikkaran is a bold, message-driven film that tries to inspire change through cinema.

<p>Lover, directed by Anish Krishna, is a romantic drama that attempts to blend love, emotions, and action. Raj Tarun plays Raj, a carefree, happy-go-lucky guy who falls in love with Charitha, a responsible and kind-hearted nurse played by Riddhi Kumar. The film starts off light and charming, with some breezy romantic moments and songs that set a pleasant tone. However, as the story progresses, it takes a more serious turn with unexpected twists and action elements. Raj Tarun brings energy to his role, and the chemistry between the leads is sweet, though the emotional depth doesn’t always hit hard. Music by Ankit Tiwari and others adds to the romantic mood. Lover is a decent one-time watch for fans of youthful love stories with a bit of action.
